            <p>
    Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption-based tax applied to goods and services
    across the European Union. It is collected incrementally at each stage of the
    supply chain, from production to final sale, but the total tax burden is
    ultimately borne by the end consumer. Businesses act as tax collectors on
    behalf of the government by charging VAT on sales and remitting it to tax
    authorities.
</p>

<p>
    VAT rates are not uniform across the EU. Each country sets its own standard
    and reduced rates, which can change over time. Understanding these variations
    is essential for accurate billing and compliance, especially for freelancers
    providing services internationally.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
    The One Stop Shop (OSS) scheme is an EU-wide initiative designed to simplify
    VAT compliance for businesses providing cross-border digital services and
    certain goods. Instead of registering for VAT in every EU country where
    customers are located, businesses can submit a single VAT return through
    the OSS portal in their home country.
</p>

<p>
    This system significantly reduces administrative overhead and reporting
    complexity. However, businesses must still calculate VAT accurately for
    each customer’s country, making reliable calculation tools essential for
    proper OSS compliance.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
    Freelancers frequently work with clients from multiple EU countries, each
    with different VAT rates and regulatory requirements. Manually tracking
    these variations can lead to calculation errors, compliance risks, and
    potential penalties from tax authorities.
</p>

<p>
    The VAT Auto Calculator helps freelancers automate VAT calculations by
    instantly applying the correct country-specific rate. This reduces errors,
    saves time, and allows freelancers to focus on their core work while staying
    fully compliant with EU VAT and OSS regulations.
