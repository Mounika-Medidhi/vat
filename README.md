📌 Project Overview

The EU VAT Auto Calculator is a web-based SaaS application that helps freelancers calculate Value Added Tax (VAT) for services provided to clients across European Union (EU) countries. It automatically applies the correct VAT rate based on the client’s country and displays the VAT and total invoice amount instantly.

This project aims to simplify VAT calculation, reduce manual errors, and help freelancers comply with EU VAT (OSS scheme) regulations.
